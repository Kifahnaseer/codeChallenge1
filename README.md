Description
This repository has 3 code challenges. The first prompts the user to input student marks then outputs the correct grade. The second takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.The third calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
